# Script-ZeroTier-For-ParrotOS
Correction of the Zerotier script so that it recognizes ParrotOS as derivative of debian

The ZeroTier script fails to perform the debian version check because parrot does not detect it as a debian derived distro.
I have corrected this bug and now it works with parrot.
